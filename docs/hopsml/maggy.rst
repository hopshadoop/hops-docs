Maggy
======

AutoML using Asynchronous PySpark
--------------------------------------------

Maggy is a framework for efficient asynchronous optimization of expensive black-box functions in Hopsworks.

In Hopsworks, Maggy is mostly used to run experiments for:

  * Directed Hyperparameter Search (ASHA, Bayesian) on TensorFlow, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, XGBoost;

  * Parallel Ablation Studies. Without changing your inner training loop in TensorFlow, evaluate (in parallel) the effect of regularization techniques;

  * Unified Logging in Jupyter notebooks. In real-time, view logs for parallel HParam/Ablation study tasks from your Jupyter notebook.
