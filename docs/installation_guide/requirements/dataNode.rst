========================
DataNode and NodeManager
========================

A typical deployment of Hops Hadoop installs both the Hops DataNode and NodeManager on a set of commodity servers, running without RAID (replication is done in software) in a 12-24 hard-disk JBOD setup. Depending on your expected workloads, you can put as much RAM and CPU in the nodes as needed. Configurations can have up to (and probably more) than 512 GB RAM and 32 cores.

The recommended setup for these machines in production (on a cost-performance basis) is:

.. tabularcolumns:: {| p{\dimexpr 0.3\linewidth-2\tabcolsep} | p{\dimexpr 0.7\linewidth-2\tabcolsep}|}
