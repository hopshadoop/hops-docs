*******************
Hops Auto Installer
*******************

The Hops stack includes a number of services also requires a number of third-party distributed services:

* Java 1.7 (OpenJDK or Oracle JRE/JDK)
* NDB 7.4+ (MySQl Cluster)
* J2EE7 web application server (Glassfish by default)
* ElasticSearch 1.7+
  
Due to the complexity of installing and configuring all Hops' services, we recommend installing Hops using the automated installer Karamel/Chef (http://www.karamel.io). We do not provide documentation for installing and configuring all services, but for the curious, the Chef cookbooks that install our services are available at: https://github.com/hopshadoop.


Cloud Platforms (EC2, GCE, OpenStack)
-------------------------------------

Karamel/Chef
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Download and install Karamel (http://www.karamel.io).
#. Run Karamel.
#. Click on the "Load Cluster Definition" menu item in Karamel. You are now prompted to select a cluster definition YAML file. Go to the examples/stable directory, and select a cluster definition file for your target cloud platform for one of the following cluster types:

   #. Amazon Web Services (EC2)
   #. Google Compute Engine (GCE)
   #. OpenStack
   #. On premises (bare metal)

For more information on how to configure cloud-based installations, go to help documentation at http://www.karamel.io.
For on-premises installations, we provide some additional installation details and tips later in this section.


**Choosing which services to run on which nodes**

You now need to decide which services you will install on which nodes. In Karamel, we design a set of *Node Groups*, where each *Node Group* defines a stack of services to be installed on a machine. Each machine will only have one *Node Group* set of services.
We now provide two recommended setup:

* a *single node cluster* that includes all services on a single node.
* a *tiny cluster* set of *heavy* stacks that includes a lot of services on each node.
* a *small cluster* set of *heavy* stacks that includes lots of services on each node.
* a *large cluster* set of *light* stacks that includes fewer services on each node.

**Single Node Setup**
You can run the entire HopsWorks application platform on a single node. You will have a NodeGroup with the following services on the single node:

#. HopsWorks, Elasticsearch, Zeppelin, MySQL Server, NDB Mgmt Server, HDFS NameNode, YARN ResourceManager, NDB Data Node(s), HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager


**Tiny Cluster Setup**

We recommend the following setup that includes the following NodeGroups, and requires at least 2 nodes to be deployed:

#. HopsWorks, Elasticsearch, Zeppelin, MySQL Server, NDB Mgmt Server, HDFS NameNode, YARN ResourceManager, NDB Data Node
#. HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager

This is really only a test setup, but you will have one node dedicated to YARN applications and file storage, while the other node handles the metadata layer services.


**Small Cluster Setup**

We recommend the following setup that includes four NodeGroups, and requires at least 4 nodes to be deployed:

#. HopsWorks, Elasticsearch, Zeppelin, MySQL Server, NDB Mgmt Server, 
#. HDFS NameNode, YARN ResourceManager, MySQL Server 
#. NDB Data Node
#. HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager    

A highly available small cluster would require at least two instances of the last three NodeGroups. HopsWorks can also be deployed on mulitple instances, but Elasticsearch needs to be specially configured if it is to be sharded across many insances.
  
**Large Cluster Setup**

We recommend the following setup that includes six NodeGroups, and requires at least 4 nodes to be deployed:

#. Elasticsearch
#. HopsWorks, Zeppelin, MySQL Server, NDB Mgmt Server
#. HDFS NameNode, MySQL Server
#. YARN ResourceManager, MySQL Server       
#. NDB Data Node
#. HDFS DataNode, YARN NodeManager    

A highly available large cluster would require at least two instances of every NodeGroup. HopsWorks can also be deployed on mulitple instances, while Elasticsearch needs to be specially configured if it is to be sharded across many insances. Otherwise, the other services can be easily scaled out by simply adding instances in Karamel. For improved performance, the metadata layer could be deployed on a better network (10 GbE at the time of writing), and the last NodeGroup (DataNode/NodeManager) instances could be deployed on cheaper network infrastructure (bonded 1 GbE  or 10 GbE, at the time of writing).


HopsWorks Configuration in Karamel
-----------------------------------

Karamel Chef recipes support a large number of parameters that can be set while installing Hops. These parameters include, but are not limited to,:

* usernames to install and run services as,
* usernames and passwords for services, and
* sizing and tuning configuration parameters for services (resources used, timeouts, etc).
    

Here are some of the most important security parameters to set when installing services:

* Superuser username and password for the MySQL Server(s)
  * Default: 'kthfs' and 'kthfs'
* Administration username and password for the Glassfish administration account(s)
  * Default: 'adminuser' and 'adminpw'      
* Administration username and password for HopsWorks
  * Default: 'admin@kth.se' and 'admin'            

Here are some of the most important sizing configuration parameters to set when installing services:

* DataMemory for NDB Data Nodes 
* YARN NodeManager amount of memory and number of CPUs
* Heap size and Direct Memory for the NameNode
* Heap size for Glassfish
* Heap size for Elasticsearch


On-Premises Installation
---------------------------

For on-premises (bare-metal) installations, You will need to prepare for installation by:

#. identifying a *master* host, from which you will run Karamel;

   #. the *master* must have a display for Karamel's user interface;
   #. the *master* must be able to ping (and connect using ssh) to all of the *target* hosts.
   
#. identifying a set of *target* hosts, on which the Hops software and 3rd party services will be installed.

   #. the *target* nodes should have outside http access to download software from the open Internet (although cookbooks can be configured to download software from within the private network with a bit of configuration work).

   
As the *master* must be able to connect using SSH to all the *target* nodes, on which the software will be installed, you can first prepare the machines as follows:

#. Create an openssh public/private key pair on the *master* host for your user account. On Linux, you can use the ssh-keygen utility program to generate the keys, which will by default be stored in the ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa and $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` files. If you decided to enter a password for the ssh keypair, you will need to enter it again in Karamel when you reach the ``ssh`` dialog, part of Karamel's ``Launch`` step.
#. Create a user account ``USER`` on the all the *target* machines with full sudo privileges (root privileges) and the same password on all *target* machines. 
#. Copy the $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file on the *master* to the /tmp folder of all the *target* hosts. A good way to do this is to use ``pscp`` utility along with a file (``hosts.txt``) containing the line-separated hostnames (or IP addresss) for all the *target* machines. You may need to install the pssh utility programs (``pssh``), first.

.. code-block:: bash   

   $sudo apt-get install pssh
   or
   $yum install pssh
 
   $vim hosts.txt
      # Enter the row-separated IP addresses of all target nodes in hosts.txt
           128.112.152.122
           18.31.0.190
           128.232.103.201
           .....

   $pscp -h hosts.txt -P PASSWORD -i USER ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /tmp
   $pssh -h hosts.txt -i USER -P PASSWORD mkdir -p /home/USER/.ssh
   $pssh -h hosts.txt -i USER -P PASSWORD cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub 
          >> /home/USER/.ssh/authorized_keys
   
Update your Karamel cluster definition file to include the IP addresses of the *target* machines and the ``USER`` account. After you have clicked on the ``launch`` menu item, you will come to a ``Ssh`` dialog. On the ``ssh`` dialog, you need to open the advanced section. Here, you will need to enter the password for the ``USER`` account on the *target* machines (``sudo password`` text input box). 
If your ssh keypair is password protected, you will also need to enter it again here in the ``keypair password`` text input box.


:Note: `Redhat/Centos is not yet supported by Karamel, but you can install Hops using Chef-solo by logging into each machine separately. The chef cookbooks are written to work for both Ubuntu and Redhat platforms.`


Vagrant
-------

You can install HopsWorks and Hops on your laptop/desktop  with Vagrant. You will need to have the following software packages installed:

* chef-dk, version >0.5+ (but not >0.8+)
* git
* vagrant
* vagrant omnibus plugin (``vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus``)    
* virtualbox

You can now run vagrant, using:

.. code-block:: bash     

    $ git clone https://github.com/hopshadoop/hopsworks-chef.git
    $ cd hopsworks-chef
    $ berks vendor cookbooks
    $ vagrant up

You can then access Hopsworks from your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/hopsworks. The default credentials are:

::

  username: admin@kth.se
  password: admin

The Glassfish web application server is also available from your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/hopsworks. The default credentials are:

::

  username: adminuser
  password: adminpw

Windows
-------

You can also install HopsWorks on vagrant and Windows. You will need to follow the vagrant instructions as above (installing the same software packages) aswell as installing:

* Powershell

After cloning the github repo, from the powershell, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash     

    $ cd hopsworks-chef
    $ berks vendor cookbooks
    $ vagrant up
  
Apple OSX/Mac
-------------------

First, install protobuf and cmake:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install protobuf250
    $ brew install cmake

Note: you need protobuf version 2.5 (not 2.6). You can check if it's already installed with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ protoc --version
    libprotoc 2.5.0

Hops runs on JDK 1.7, so you should have that installed (download it `here`_). However, due to some inconsistencies between Java version you'll have to create a symlink like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_17.jdk/Contents/Home/
    sudo mkdir Classes && cd Classes
    sudo ln -s ../jre/lib/rt.jar classes.jar

.. _here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

You should now be able to clone the repositories and build the code.
