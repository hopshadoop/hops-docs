Upload Data
===========================

Files can be uploaded using Hopsworks' web interface. Go to the
project you want to upload the file(s) to. You must have the **Data Owner**
role for that project to be able to upload files. In the **Data Sets**
tab, on the top left corner there is the *Upload* button.

After pressing on the *Upload* button, the following window will
appear which will let you select the files or folders from your local
hard drive by clicking on *Upload File* or *Upload Folder*. Next step
is to click *Upload all* which will upload your datasets. At any time
you can pause the uploading and resume it later. There is no limit at
the size of the files.
