Update your Profile/Password
============================

After you have logged in, in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, you will see your **email address with a caret icon**. Click on the caret icon, then click on the menu item ``Account``.
A dialog will pop-up, from where you can change your password and other parts of your profile. You cannot change your email address and will need to create a new account if you wish to change your email address. You can also logout by clicking on the ``sign out`` menu item.
