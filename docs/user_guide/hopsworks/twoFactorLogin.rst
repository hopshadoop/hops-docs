    Hopsworks registration with two factor authentication

You should have a one-time password generator installed at your
smartphone, such as `Google Authenticator`_. After you have clicked
the ``Register`` button, scan with your smartphone the QR code
presented to you. Next time you login again, it will prompt you both
for your password and for the six-digits one-time password generated by the
application at your smartphone.
